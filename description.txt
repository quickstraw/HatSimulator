Hat Simulator is a mod that mainly adds hats from Team Fortess 2. There are a couple other hats as well inspired by other games/whatever looks cool. Every hat added by this mod also has an Unusual version.

[IMPORTANT]
Please let me know if you find any issues with the mod.

Features:
        - 1 Town NPC
        - 40+ vanity items

Many cosmetic items added are inspired by Team Fortress 2 cosmetics or from other games. Hat Lock Boxes will drop after the the Eater of Worlds or Brain of Cthulu is killed.

There are 4 Hat Lock Boxes that can be opened to obtain different sets of hats. A Hat Lock Box must be opened with a key bought from the Hat Salesman. There is a small chance to obtain a hat with an unusual effect after opening a Hat Lock Box.

The Lock Boxes are called Lock Boxes instead of crates to match the Terraria naming scheme.

Town NPCs:
Hat Salesman     - Sells keys to open lockboxes.

Currently Working On:
Nothing in particular. Let me know if you have any ideas.
I'll probably improve some of the sprites over time.
